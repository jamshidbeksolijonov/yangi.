    <h5>once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called <i>True Stories from Nature, </i>
    about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constriktor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is copy of the drawing. </h5>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h5>In the book it said: <i><q>Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing </q></i>it. <i>After that they are not able 
        to move, and they sleep through thesix months that they need for digestion
    </i> </h5>
    <h5>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with colored peneil I succeeded in making my first 
        darwing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:  
    </h5>

    <h5>I showed my masterpicce to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightend them.</h5>
    <h5>But the  answered: <q><i>Frighten? Why should any be frightened by a hat?</i></q></h5>
    <h5>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was not a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephent.
        But since the grown-ups were not able to anderstand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a 
        boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.
        My Drawing Number Two looked like this:

    <h5>The grown-ups response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa  constrictors, whether from the inside or the 
        outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up
        what might have beena magnificent career a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number Two, Grown-ups 
        never understand anything by themselves, and it is trisome for children to be always and forevar explaining Things to them.
